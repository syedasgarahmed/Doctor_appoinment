# Doctor_appoinment
simple Doctor Appointment API

To run code:

Make sure you have Python and Flask installed.
Save the code to a file (e.g., app.py).
Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the file is located.
Run the API using the command python appointment_api.py.
Here are the endpoints you can use:

List all doctors: GET /doctors
Retrieve details of a specific doctor: GET /doctors/<doctor_id>(example 1)
Book an appointment with a doctor: POST /appointments
Please note that this is a simplified example. In a real-world application, you would typically use a database to store and manage doctor and appointment data. You would also need to implement more robust appointment booking logic, including checking doctor availability, managing appointment slots, and handling scheduling conflicts.



To use the API endpoints created in the example above, you can make HTTP requests to the respective endpoints using a tool like curl, a web browser, or any HTTP client library in your preferred programming language (e.g., Python's requests library).

Here's how you can use each of the endpoints:

List all doctors (GET /doctors):

To retrieve a list of all doctors, you can make a GET request to the /doctors endpoint. You will receive a JSON response with the list of doctors. Here's an example using curl:

**curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/doctors**
You can also use a web browser to access the URL **http://localhost:5000/doctors** to see the list of doctors.

Retrieve details of a specific doctor (GET /doctors/<doctor_id>):

To retrieve details of a specific doctor, make a GET request to the /doctors/<doctor_id> endpoint, where <doctor_id> should be replaced with the actual ID of the doctor you want to retrieve. Here's an example using curl:

**curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/doctors/1**
This will retrieve details for the doctor with ID 1.

Book an appointment (POST /appointments):

To book an appointment with a doctor, you need to make a POST request to the /appointments endpoint with the necessary data. You can send a JSON payload with the doctor_id and appointment_date. Here's an example using curl:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"doctor_id": 1, "appointment_date": "2023-10-10"}' http://localhost:5000/appointments
This example books an appointment with the doctor having ID 1 on the specified date.
